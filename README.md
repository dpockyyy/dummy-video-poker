# PROJECT #1 - Video Poker
Video poker first became commercially viable when it became economical to combine a television like monitor with a solid state central processing unit and first appeared in the mid 1970s. Thoughout the 1980s video poker became increasingly popular in casinos and nowadays is a popular option in many casinos. My project is a remake of the classic casino game video poker with an increased payout rate for your gaming enjoyment.

### Getting Started:

- play begins by placing a bet of one or more credits and pressing the 'deal' button
- the player is then given 5 cards (like five-card draw) and has the opportunity to discard one or more of them in exchange for new ones drawn from the same virtual deck.
- after the draw, the machine pays out if the hand played matches one of the winning combinations which are posted in the pay table.
